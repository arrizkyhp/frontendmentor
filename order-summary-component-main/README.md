## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM naming
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension
- [GulpJS](https://gulpjs.com/) - JS library

### What I learned

Since this is my first project using **Sass** and **GulpJS** i learned about Structuring Sass project, my css is neater, and its feels more fun to coding this way. I feel more excited to learn more deeply üòÅ

I think this also my first time combine SVG and color for background.

```css
body {
  background: $pale-blue url("../../images/pattern-background-desktop.svg");
  background-size: contain;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

### Continued development

this area, it's look the same as design, but the way i coding it, it doesn't feel okay for me because i added a margin-bottom to seperate the two element, i try to do it with flex and grid but still not find the solution.
