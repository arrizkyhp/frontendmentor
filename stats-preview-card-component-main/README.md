## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM naming
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension
- [GulpJS](https://gulpjs.com/) - JS library

### What I learned

This is my second time doing it with Sass and gulpp, im still little bit confused about how to place media query in "the right way".

So in this challenge i learned how to add color to grayscale image using this _mix-blend-mode: multiply_ and then adding empty div _image\_\_filter_ with 0.25 opacity.

```css
img {
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}

&__filter {
  background: $soft-violet;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  position: absolute;
  opacity: 0.25;
  z-index: 1;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
```

```html
<div class="image__filter"></div>
```
